For any variable with missing values, change the data to include a missing category instead of a missing value for the categorical variable. 
  - (HINT: Now all variables should be categorized (treated as categorical variables so no more continuous variable assumptions) and without missing values. Banks 
          do this for more advanced modeling purposes that we will talk about in the spring.)
          
#I found INV, CC, CCPURC, and HMOWN to have missing values that will need to be updated  

```{r}
# changing all int columns to character columns so a new missing "M" category can be added 
bank_bin1 <- bank_bin %>% mutate(across(where(is.integer), as.character))

#replacing all NA with an indicator "M"
bank_bin1 <- bank_bin1 %>% replace(is.na(.),"M")

#checking the 4 variables that had NA in original dataset
print(unique(bank_bin$INV))
print(unique(bank_bin$CC))
print(unique(bank_bin$CCPURC))
print(unique(bank_bin$HMOWN))

#checking to see if the NA's were replaced with "M" in bank_bin1
print(unique(bank_bin1$INV))

#Check each variable for separation concerns. Document in the report and adjust any variables with complete or quasi-separation concerns

#I found 2 variables with quasi-complete seperation (and none with complete seperation)
CASHBK, MMCRED

```{r}
print(table(bank_bin1$INS, bank_bin1$CASHBK))
```

#CASHBK
(CASHBK = 2) has no occurrences of (INS = 1), so will merge (CASHBK = 2) with (CASHBK = 1) into "1+"


```{r}
#fixing CASHBK by merging (CASHBK = 1 | CASHBK = 2) into (CASHBK = "1+")
bank_bin1$CASHBK.c <- as.character(bank_bin1$CASHBK)
bank_bin1$CASHBK.c[which(bank_bin1$CASHBK %in% c("1","2"))] <- "1+"
#print(table(bank_bin1$CASHBK.c, bank_bin$CASHBK))
print(table(bank_bin1$INS, bank_bin1$CASHBK.c))
```

```{r}
print(table(bank_bin1$INS, bank_bin1$MMCRED))
```
#MMCRED

(MMCRED = 5) only has no occurrences of (INS = 1), so will merge (MMCRED = 5) with (MMCRED = 3) into "3+"
    note for danny: MMCRED = 4 does not exist in the training dataset
    Dr. Labarr --> should we also be checking in the validation set for seperation
